# FUTURE_DS_01
As part of my tasks in the Internship with Future Interns. I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI using a real-world e-commerce dataset to uncover insights such as best-selling products, monthly sales trends, and revenue by category and region. I demonstrated skills such as data cleaning, DAX formulas, and business storytelling with visuals.
